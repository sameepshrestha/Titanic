This is where most of the machine learning students start their journey with. For this problem we had to determine which of the passengers were likely to survive with the data available .
Feature engineering was interesting and exciting to implement in this problem where the number of family members and others where evaluated from the existing dataset. In this problem use 
was made of different classification methods such as decesion tree classifier, logisticc regression and neural network. Ensemble model such as Random forest classifier was also utilized.
Almost all the models with the tuned parameters had almost same accuracy thus an ensemble model was made with the average of the prediction from four models to increaser the 
accuracy and was successful to be ranked under 17% of the participants.
